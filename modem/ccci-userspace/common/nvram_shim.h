/*
 * NVM_GetFileDesc(lid, size_out, reserved, mode) -- opens the LID's backing
 * file and returns a REAL POSIX file descriptor (disassembly-confirmed: the
 * returned value in x0 is passed directly as the first argument to
 * __read_chk(fd, buf, count, buflen) at the call site, i.e. libnvram opens
 * the file itself and hands back an fd, it does not hand back an opaque
 * handle needing translation).
 *   - `size_out`: an out-parameter (int*) the disassembly shows filled in
 *     by the call and then used, sign-extended, as the read() length --
 *     almost certainly "how many bytes to read for this record."
 *   - `reserved`: a second pointer argument (mov x2, sp) whose target is
 *     never read back by ccci_mdinit's own code after the call in either
 *     traced call site -- pass a valid zeroed word, do not pass NULL
 *     (unverified whether the callee itself dereferences it
 *     unconditionally).
 *   - `mode`: 0 in both traced call sites (both are reads). The write path
 *     was not observed in ccci_mdinit (it only ever reads MD_SBP), so the
 *     nonzero value(s) for write are UNVERIFIED -- do not guess a write
 *     call against this shim without confirming mode's write value first
 *     (a wrong mode on a real NVRAM LID risks corrupting it).
 * Return: a struct-by-value in x0:x1 (AAPCS64 packs a <=16-byte, two
 * 8-byte-field aggregate return into x0/x1) -- x0 is consumed as the fd,
 * x1 ("token") is disassembly-confirmed saved across the call and fed
 * verbatim into NVM_CloseFileDesc's second argument. We model this as a
 * `long`-pair struct rather than committing to the field types the real
 * implementation uses internally, since only the register-level ABI
 * outcome (which we replicate) was actually observed, not the source type.

 * 32-bit-clean value is sufficient even though the parameter slot is 64-bit.
 * Return: nonzero on success (checked via `tbnz w0, #0` -- "branch if bit 0
 * set"), matching ccci_mdinit treating bit0==1 as success.
